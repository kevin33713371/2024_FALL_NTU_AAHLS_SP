## Experiment Overview
Lab1 - A simple experiment to understand the operation of HLS and the use of its tools through multiplication. <br /> <br />
Lab2 - Understanding the port-level protocol for data transmission through the design of an FIR filter on AXI4 Master and AXI4 Stream interfaces. <br /> <br />
Lab3 - Learning to write host code using OpenCL , simulating and analyzing kernel code on Alveo series FPGA boards. <br /> <br />
LabA_RTL_Kernel_Workflow - Learning how to package the IP previously designed by RTL and integrate it into the Vitis simulation environment for simulation. <br /> <br />
LabA_Mixing_C_RTL_Kernels - Learning to integrate an HLS-designed C kernel with an RTL-designed module into the Vitis simulation environment for joint simulation. <br /> <br />
LabB_Systolic_Array - Using the learned "pragma" directives to design a Systolic Array and analyze the differences between Broadcasting and Propagating. <br /> <br />
